    "\n",
    "The rise of social media platforms in the USA has transformed the way people communicate and share information. With its increasing popularity, these platforms have also become prime targets for cyber-attacks, which can range from data breaches to spreading misinformation. It is essential for companies and individuals to understand the patterns of these attacks to prevent potential threats in the future. "

    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing: \n",
    "- Handle missing values. \n",
    "- Convert text data into numerical data using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings. \n",
    "- Normalize and scale the features. \n",
    "2. Model Building: \n",
    "- Use TensorFlow and Keras to construct a deep learning model. \n",
    "- The model may consist of dense layers, dropout for regularization, and other components as deemed necessary. \n",
    " \n",
    "3. Training and Evaluation: \n",
    "- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets. \n",
    "- Train the model on the training data and validate its performance on the validation set. \n",
    "- Evaluate the final model performance on the test set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). \n",
    "4. Forward Propagation: \n",
    "- Once the model is trained, use it to predict the likelihood of cyber-attacks on new, unseen data by applying forward propagation. \n",
    "- Ensure that the input data is preprocessed in the same way as the training data before making predictions. \n",
    "5. Report and Analysis: \n",
    "- Provide insights into which features are the most significant indicators of a potential cyber-attack. \n",
    "- Offer recommendations for social media users and platforms to enhance their security measures. "
